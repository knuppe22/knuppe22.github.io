#### 4D VR
* To enhance users' VR immersion, studies are conducted to integrate the visual stimulus via an HMD and the vestibular stimulus via a motion platform. [[video]](https://youtu.be/B2SWp6XFHvM)

#### Pseudo Haptics
* We study techniques to manipulate the users' perception so that they feel a virtual force without any physical haptic equipment. For example, in a virtual underwater application, the user is made to feel water resistance. [[video]](https://youtu.be/qkMbVsgwVQk)

#### 3D User Interface
* We study techniques to manipulate 3D objects quickly and accurately in immersive virtual environments. [[video]](https://youtu.be/3Am4Rf2KD-I)

#### Performance Capture
* Studies are conducted to extract 3D models and motions at real time with an RGB-D camera. It can be used to develop AR systems for virtual concerts, teleconferences, and so on. [[video]](https://youtu.be/hbuuXuwsmlk)

#### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for Inspection
* A combination of RGB camera-based SLAM and AR technology is used for industrial inspection.

#### 3D Scanning and Reverse Engineering
* We study automatic 3D CAD model reconstruction from the scanned data of industrial sites using an RGB-D camera. [[video]](https://youtu.be/rjVbIZ-AUkU)

#### Pose Estimation
* We develop a motion capture technique that uses a single RGB camera. It uses multiple frames of the input video to improve accuracy. [[video]](https://youtu.be/ooOfPQu7Bik)

#### Character Control
* We study a deep learning based controller which shows the natural movements of characters. The controller is trained using iterative physics based simulations so as to work in various environments.

#### Volumetric Segmentation in Medical Images
* We study methods for detecting malignant tumors in medical images such as MRI and CT scans. [[video]](https://youtu.be/VBx8JUo0Ous)

#### Magnetic Object Simulation
* The forces exerted on magnetic objects are calculated using Maxwell's equations to mimic the realistic motions of magnetic objects. [[video]](https://youtu.be/m5s5BAKCMcE)

#### Deformable Body Simulation
* Calculating the restoring forces determined in continuum mechanics, we mimic deformable bodies' various motions such as deformation, collision, translation, and rotation. [[video]](https://youtu.be/jxtL2S10FLo)

#### Virtual Science Experiments
* We develop a simulation/rendering engine and an authoring tool specialized for science experiments in virtual worlds, and we conduct researches demonstrating the effectiveness of virtual science experiments. [[video]](https://youtu.be/4ML1CGrMKQg)
